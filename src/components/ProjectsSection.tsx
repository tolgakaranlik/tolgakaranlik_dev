					A mobile game, which is published in both the Google Play and the Apple AppStore. Currently it was downloaded more than 50K times in Google Play alone and had 4.9 stars so far. I have been the head of development of its gameplay logic, client application, server side, database side and every single technical aspect of the game. Also, other than handling a fast and secure game play, a back office and a huge management portal was coded from scratched, and I was the one who planned, coordinated and coded the back bone of that backend system. <br />&nbsp;

I was reporting the lead developer Bryan, they wanted me to find efficient ways to roam seamlessly in a huge world without any loading screen or any sort of wait. For this purpose, I had to implement an interest based system, which had to dynamically load and unload some parts of Unity terrain with a 100% compatibility to the games Playfab based multiplayer system.

I did not code only a game play with single player campaign, different unit types with different capabilities, different skill trees and different states; as well as its AI system with the variable difficulty system; I also coded a replay system with the deterministic computation to lower the disk cost of replay files dramatically while maintaining the accuracy of providing a full replay session. Finally, I have coded a multiplayer system on Photon Fusion which would allow being able to play the game upto 8 players on the same session. Although the project is not published on any game store, you can see the video and view the Github repository.

				>In this project, I fully coded an ARPG game with a single player story driven game mechanics with some challenges. Instead of designing the level on Unity Editor, I coded a system to design the level while I am playing (in the Play mode of Unity). Moreover, I also did not want to see any "loading" signs, I coded a system to partially load the environment on the fly and release the parts that I went far from. One final challenge was to generate the dungeons that we enter on the fly. After spending some time on it, I thought it would be easier to use an asset named Dungeon Architect so I used it instead of designing the same mechanism from scratch.<br />

					I was the one who planned and implementing the full backend infrastructure. The whole infrastructure was designed on the NodeJS and the PosgreSQL that was hosted on the Neon servers. File storage was running on the Digital Ocean space. The biggest challenge of this project was to build the landscape to handle the huge workload of database systems, but thanks to the flexability and the reliability of the Neon and Digital Ocean systems, everything went on track. In this project, I also established a fully automated CI/CD system based on Jenkins, which automated the build, sign and update our weekly builds on target platforms, such as Google Play and Apple App Store.<br />

					Basics of this system was established when I joined the team, so my job was to plan and to monitor the development cycle. The whole backend system had two major components: the blockhain side and the operational side. The Blockchain part was more straight forward, Moralis system was capable of managing the whole Solidity and Ethereum side. We didn't have an in-house Solidity team so I did not have much influence on them, that team was responding to the CTO. When it come tho the operation side, that was my field of play. Entire system is placed on the AWS landscape, so we used Amazon RDS (Remote Dabatase System) infrastructure with PostgreSQL. It was operated on NodeJS which are located on EC2 servers. By the time we added some additional support by occupying side systems like Amazon Cognito for user authentication, Unity Cloud Build for CI/CD, etc.<br />
